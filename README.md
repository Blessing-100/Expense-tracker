Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for Expense Tracker

1. Requirement Analysis
The Expense Tracker is designed to help users record and manage their daily expenses.
At this stage, the system requirements are identified and documented.
Functional Requirements:
The system should allow users to add expenses.
Each expense should include a description, amount, and date.
The system should display all recorded expenses.
The system should calculate and display the total expenses.
The system should allow the user to exit the program safely.
Non-Functional Requirements:
The system should be easy to use.
The system should respond quickly.
The program should run efficiently on a computer system.

2. System Design
In this phase, the internal structure of the Expense Tracker is planned.
Design Decisions:
Programming Language: Python
Type of Application: Console-based application
Data Structure: List of dictionaries to store expenses
System Components:
Input module to collect expense details.
Processing module to store and calculate expenses.
Output module to display expenses and totals.
Naming Conventions:
Functions use meaningful names such as add_expense, view_expenses, and calculate_total.
Variables use descriptive names such as expenses, amount, and date.

3. Implementation (Coding)
In this stage, the system design is translated into Python code.
Functions are created for adding expenses, viewing expenses, and calculating totals.
A menu-driven structure is implemented to allow user interaction.
Expenses are stored temporarily in memory during program execution.
The code follows proper indentation and syntax rules of Python.

4. Testing
The Expense Tracker is tested to ensure it works correctly.
Testing includes:
Adding expenses with valid inputs.
Viewing all stored expenses.
Checking correct calculation of total expenses.
Testing menu options for correct responses.
Handling invalid user input.
Any errors found during testing are corrected before moving to the next phase.

5. Deployment
After successful testing, the Expense Tracker program is deployed.
The Python file is saved as expensetracker.py.
The program is executed using the Python interpreter.
The application is made available for use by users.

6. Maintenance
After deployment, maintenance activities may be carried out.
Fixing bugs discovered during usage.
Improving system performance.
Adding new features such as file storage or expense categorization.
