#  Expense Tracker (Python Project)

##  Project Overview
The Expense Tracker is a Python-based, console application developed to help users record, manage, and monitor their daily expenses.

This project was created as an academic exercise to demonstrate the practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a real-world problem scenario.

---

##  Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- To design a simple expense management system  
- To allow users to record daily expenses  
- To calculate total expenses automatically  
- To apply SDLC principles in software development  
- To improve problem-solving and programming skills using Python  

---

##  Features of the System
The Expense Tracker provides the following features:

- Add new expenses with description, amount, and date  
- View all recorded expenses  
- Calculate and display total expenses  
- Menu-driven user interface for easy navigation  
- Simple and user-friendly console interaction  

---

##  Technology Used
The technologies used in developing this project include:

- Programming Language: Python  
- Application Type: Console-based application  
- Development Approach: Procedural programming  

---

##  Project Structure
The project files are organized as follows:

---

##  How the System Works
The system operates through a menu-driven interface:

1. The user selects an option from the menu  
2. The system performs the selected operation  
3. Expense data is stored temporarily during program execution  
4. Results are displayed immediately to the user

##  Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Used

### 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis
At this stage, the problem was analyzed and the system requirements were identified.  
The system must allow users to add expenses, view expenses, and calculate total spending.

---

### 2️⃣ System Design
The system design defines how the Expense Tracker will operate internally.

- Python is used as the programming language  
- A list of dictionaries is used to store expense records  
- Functions are created for each major operation  

---

### 3️⃣ Implementation
In this phase, the system design was translated into Python code.

- Functions were implemented for adding and viewing expenses  
- A menu-driven loop was created for user interaction  
- Proper variable and function naming conventions were followed  

---

### 4️⃣ Testing
The system was tested to ensure:

- Expenses are added correctly  
- Total expenses are calculated accurately  
- Menu options respond correctly  
- Invalid inputs are handled properly  

Any detected errors were corrected before deployment.

---

### 5️⃣ Deployment
After testing, the system was saved as expensetracker.py and executed using the Python interpreter.

The application is ready for use in a standard Python environment.

---

### 6️⃣ Maintenance
Future improvements may include:

- Saving expenses to a file  
- Adding expense categories  
- Improving input validation  
- Enhancing user interface design  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
Follow the steps below to run the application:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt  
3. Navigate to the project folder  
4. Run the command below:

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The Expense Tracker project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-world problems while following the SDLC process.

The project is simple, efficient, and suitable for academic and learning purposes. 🎓✨
